I have used almost all the popular static site generators and I always wanted to make one.

As my vacations were going on and I was thinking of doing some project stuff, It was the right time to make it happen so I started.I wanted it to be almost similar to Jekyll and also compatible with Netlify CMS. 

I had experience of development of SSG using C++ and it helped me in achieving what I wanted in almost 2 hours. 

## HIGHLIGHTS OF my_py_site

  * YML Front matter is supported
  * Jinja 2 Templates
  * Almost similary to Jekyll
  * Deploy on Netlify (Just fork and add it to netlify)
  * Compatible with Netlify CMS
  * Made in India :smile:

I think [my_py_site](https://github.com/sharadcodes/my_py_site) is the most 
simplest and lightweight static site generator out there, with less than
90 lines of code.

I'll request you all to show some â™¥ to the project and share it in the community. Also don't forget to star the repo https://github.com/sharadcodes/my_py_site

The development will go further and enhancements will be done in the future to make things more easy.

# How to use

After cloning or downloading the [https://github.com/sharadcodes/my_py_site](https://github.com/sharadcodes/my_py_site) just run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python my_py_site.py
```
and the site will be generated.

## [Live Demo](https://mypysite.netlify.com/)

**my_py_site** supports multiple blogs and pages, you dont have to do modify the `my_py_site.py` file.
