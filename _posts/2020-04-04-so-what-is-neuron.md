## The definition of Neuron

For sake of simplicity you can define it as

> It's the smallest structural building block of a neural network.

Each and every neuron in a neural network has:
* A set of inputs from x1,x2,x2 and so on till xn
* Each input has corresponding weights i.e. x1 has w1, x2 has w2 ... xn has wn.
* A non-linear function to predict.
* A single output.
